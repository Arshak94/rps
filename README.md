# Rock, Paper, Scissors game

The game have different algorithms. 
1. Random Strategy
2. Frequency-based Strategy
3. History-based Strategy
4. Adaptive Strategy (Pattern recognition)
5. etc

</br>My solution is Frequency-based Strategy algorithm.

For running and testing application you need to write 2 commands

# docker build -t rps .
# docker run -p 8080:8080 rps
